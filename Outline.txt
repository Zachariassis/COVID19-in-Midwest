Census data - pulling populaions and income from states,
                -pulling 5 most populous counties for analysis

Covid data - pulling all (for now)

Steps:
1) Gather Census population data
2) Use most populous counties to find Covid data
3) Combine and clean all data
4) Calculate and show heat maps
5) Calculate and show any additional graphs of interesting relationships
        -regression lines
        -

Outcomes:
1) deaths vs mean income
2) population vs number contracted
3) 



Nice to Haves:
1) Time series data for covid - pulling different time points
        - first case date - speed of contraction/spread
2) area of each county (sq mi)
3) compare against less populous groups
4) use more counties
